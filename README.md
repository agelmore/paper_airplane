2/27/17

## Materials and methods

1. Obtain one blank piece of paper 8.5 by 11 inches.

2. Place paper in front of you longways and fold in half lengthwise. Unfold and keep the crease.

3. Keeping the paper longways, fold the top two corners inward so that the top edge lies along the center crease.

4. Keeping the folds, flip the paper over.

5. Again, fold the top corners inward so that the diagonal edge lies along the center crease. 

6. Fold the top point down so that the upper tip meets where the previous folds connected.

7. Fold the entire plane in half length-wise with the folds in the center of the plane.

8. Place the plane in front of you horizontally and fold the wings down so that the fold makes a straight line from the top of the nose.

9. Flip the plane over and repeat the fold on the other side.

10. To fly, hold the plane under the wings and throw with forward motion.
